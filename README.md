# Unified Geometric Algebra

The unified geometric algebra is the algebraic closure of the complex geometric algebra.  By adding algebraic closure, we sacrifice the associativity of the algebra.

# Guide for making the Unified Geometric Algebra algebraically closed

Consider this variant of Newton's Method for finding the roots of polynomials

For a smooth function f, at any point x, there exists a natural number n such that

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(x&plus;dx)&space;=&space;f(x)&space;&plus;&space;\frac{d^n&space;f}{n!}(x)" title="f(x+dx) = f(x) + \frac{d^n f}{n!}(x)" />

Note, f is polynomial if and only if n has a maximum, which is called the order of the polynomial

As long as we can always choose dx such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\widehat{d^n&space;f}&space;=&space;-&space;\widehat{f}" title="\widehat{d^n f} = - \widehat{f}" />, then any polynomial has a root.

Therefore, our task is to construct the algebra so that such a dx always exists.
